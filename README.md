# Online-Compiler

A PHP website for compiling C/C++ codes online. You can just enter the code and the code on the webpage then click 'run' you can get result.

It was built with **Apache  2.4.46** and **PHP 5.6.40** on Wampserver64.So just put the source code on your root directory and run your PHP server you can deploy it.

The website is not so good and we will improve it later.
